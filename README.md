- Chrome or Chromium browser

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ndaboom/bigbluebutton-presentation-recorder.git
   cd bigbluebutton-presentation-recorder
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

1. Run the recorder(console mode):
   ```bash
   node record_meeting.js
   ```

2. The tool will:
   - Ask you for the meeting playback url
   - Open the recording in a headless browser
   - Start playback automatically
   - Show real-time progress
   - Convert/Export the final MP4 file in the current directory

### Speeding up exports

Large webinars can take a long time to play back. The UI/API recorder automatically attempts to play meetings at 1.25x speed. You can adjust this with the `BBB_PLAYBACK_RATE` environment variable (valid range `0.5` â€“ `2.0`). Example:

```bash
BBB_PLAYBACK_RATE=1.75 npm run dev
```

## Output

The recorder generates:
- High-quality MP4 file with H.264 video and AAC audio
- Filename format: `meeting_YYYY-MM-DDTHH-mm-ss-mmmZ.mp4`
- Progress updates in the console

## Progress Reporting:
The tool provides detailed progress information:
- Real-time recording progress with percentage
- Chunk sizes and total data recorded
- FFmpeg conversion progress
- Detailed status messages for each step

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Video Not Playing**
   - The tool will automatically retry playback
   - Check if the meeting URL is accessible
   - Ensure you have proper permissions to view the recording

2. **FFmpeg Errors**
   - Verify FFmpeg is installed and in PATH
   - Check available disk space
   - Ensure write permissions in output directory

3. **Memory Issues**
   - The tool uses progressive saving to handle large recordings
   - No special configuration needed for 2GB+ files
   - Temporary files are automatically cleaned up

### Debug Mode

For detailed logging, set the DEBUG environment variable:
```bash
DEBUG=1 node record_meeting.js
```
